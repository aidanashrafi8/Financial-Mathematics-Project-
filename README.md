# Financial Mathematics Project

Welcome to my Topics in Financial Mathematics Final Project repository. This project involves a detailed analysis of contingent claims on Goldman Sachs, a publicly traded stock, using Octave â€“ a MATLAB-compatible free software.

## Project Overview
The project aims to apply financial models and theories to a publicly traded company, specifically focusing on Goldman Sachs due to its active trading and availability of comprehensive data. 

## Tools and Technologies
Octave was chosen for its compatibility with MATLAB and its robust features suitable for complex financial analysis. The ease of scripting and powerful computation capabilities of Octave made it an ideal choice for this project.

## Results and Visualizations
Key results and data visualizations from the project are available in the Results pdf. These include graphs, and key outputs relevant to the project tasks.
